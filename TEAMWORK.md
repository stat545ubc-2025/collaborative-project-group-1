## _DIVISION OF LABOUR_ ##
<!-- Division of Labour: How will you divide the work required for this milestone? Be sure to include what work will be done individually, so that the work in each teammate‚Äôs pull request has clear content.
-->

For the first milestone, we all worked collaboratively. However, for the second milestone we will likely designate specific group members for each task.

### _What we did!_ ###

Kevin: Set up repo and provide initial drafts for documents 

Danielle: Set up group chat (group admin). Established groups "GRADED pull request" format as adding an emoji to our name. Will also revise the rubric prior to submission and confirm with the group that we have hit all points on the rubric.

Sasha: Fixing merge conflicts between branches, entered the graded pull request pairing and slack huddle group in the TEAMWORK.md. Also contribute to troubleshooting and README file. 

Taysia: Added to the TEAMWORK file (table of contents) and handled merge conflicts in my branch caused by multiple updates to the main branch

Jonathan: Fixing merge conflicts between pull requests, contributed to TEAMWORK.MD

## _TIMING_ ##
<!-- When will you each aim to submit your pull requests, keeping in mind that another teammate will need to review your work? Warning: Do not submit your part of the project last‚Äìminute. Your teammate may not be able to review it in time.
-->
- [ ] Pull requests will be submitted 24 hours prior to deadline of assignment to allow for adequate time to debug.
- [ ] We will consult regarding our schedule and deadlines for the week ahead of time, so we can know when to expect contributions from different members.

## _COMMUNICATION_ ##
<!-- How will you communicate with each other? For example, will you be using both Slack and GitHub Issues? For what, exactly? How long will it realistically take you to respond to a message? Will you hold a regular meeting, or rely exclusively on asynchronous communication?
--> 

- [ ] The team will use Slack for real-time discussions and GitHub Issues for task-specific communication and tracking progress. 
Slack will be used for quick questions, coordination, and for planning division of labour, while GitHub Issues will store decisions and detailed technical discussions. 
- [ ] Team members will aim to respond to Slack messages and Github issues in a timely manner (within a day) to able to complete the assignment on time.
- [ ] **We will hold a virtual check-in meetings when needed to discuss progress and next steps, these meetings will be held through our [Slack huddle group](https://app.slack.com/huddle/T09A488KAUT/C09EX911AEQ).**
