<!-- What is this project?
-->

This repository contains the **Collaborative Project Deliverable 1** for _UBC STAT 545A_.   
It serves as an exercise to gain hands-on experience with using and collaborating on GitHub.


<!-- What files are in the project folder / GitHub repository, at a high level?
-->

This repository includes:

1. A **Teamwork Markdown file** outlining the members of the group, how the group will communicate with each other and set expectations for working together. 
2. A **Troubleshooting document** containing the exercises and corrections to be completed for this deliverable.
3. A **README** file explaining the contents of our project. 


<!-- How can they run code that appears in your folder / GitHub repository? Again, at a high level.
-->
How to access code within the repository: 

Members of the group all have access to the shared GitHub repository. Each member can clone the repo/ open it as a new RStudio project to their local device, and then pull updates to stay in sync. Once the code is on their computer, they can run it.
